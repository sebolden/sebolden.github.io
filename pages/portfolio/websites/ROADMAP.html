title: "ROADMAP"
desc: "The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project was spearheaded by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network. The online tool provides comprehensive information, in written and visual form, about the paths that a rare disease organization can take in pursuit of drug repurposing. Using real world data from organizations pursuing drug repurposing, the site offers both an interactive ROADMAP tool and a report with interactive visualizations from the project's survey data. <br> <br> My role as Data Analyst involved cleaning and analyzing survey data, developing website designs and mockups, programming and testing live prototypes of the site, and coding final site pages (landing page, ROADMAP tool, survey data, and additional resources page) using HTML/CSS/JS, and implementing site hosting via GitHub Pages."
