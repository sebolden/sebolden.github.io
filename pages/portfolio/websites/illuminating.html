title: "Illuminating"
desc: "Illuminating is a computational journalism project that uses human content analysis and machine learning techniques to classify US political candidates' social media messaging and advertising; its goal is to empower journalists covering US political campaigns. Throughout my involvement with the Illuminating project, I made significant contributions to data analysis and website design. From coding social media messages of US political candidates and resolving coding disagreements, to training and overseeing undergraduate coders, to assisting with machine learning training, I played a crucial role in ensuring accurate collection and analysis of Illuminating data. Additionally, I actively participated in improving the project's website by developing mockups, incorporating new variables for analysis, creating intuitive visualizations of complex data, and publishing biweekly newsletters with website and blog updates."
