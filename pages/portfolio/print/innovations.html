title: "Innovations Magazine"
desc: "This magazine cover was developed in collaboration with iSchool Professor Dr. Jeff Hemsley and two fellow iSchool students, Tajanae Harris and Qiyi Wu. I assisted with the data collection, visualization, and design of the 3D network in the top-right quadrant of the cover. This network visualization represents a 2018 comment thread between members of the misogynistic men's rights subreddit r/MGOTW ('Men Going Their Own Way')."

image_alt: "(Quoted excerpts are from Innovations' cover description): 'This image...was initially visualized in 3D in R, then ported over to the 3D modeling tool Blender to add lighting and materials.' Alongside the gold, 3D social network in the top-right quadrant of the image, in the remaining three quadrants, are bar charts that 'illustrate cities where high numbers of iSchool alumni reside, many of whom are using their information degrees to address social issues. The map has been stripped of its outline and tilted horizontally for interest.'"
