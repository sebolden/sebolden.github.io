title: "Unsettling Boundaries: (Pre-)Digital Fat Activism, Fatphobia, and Enclave Ambivalence"
desc: "Grounded in public sphere and platform theory, this Master's thesis examines the nuances of networked fat activism on Tumblr. It argues that while the platform provides a secluded space for marginalized users, the persistence of fatphobic antagonism disrupts the platform's utopian image. By analyzing the interplay between the platform's affordances, fatphobia, and historical contexts, this thesis introduces the concept of 'enclave ambivalence' to help characterize these complex dynamics of digital activist engagement."
