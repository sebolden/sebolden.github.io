title: "Break the Internet: Gendered Image Manipulation and Political Subject Formation"
desc: "This Undergraduate thesis tasks itself with answering the following: In an era where it is common-knowledge that images are digitally manipulated, why does gendered image manipulation continue to surface as a topic of controversy and scrutiny? Drawing on feminist and critical theoretical frameworks, it argues that the cultural impulse to condem image manipulation overlooks its role in shaping political subject formation within the constraints of capitalist, democratic society. Specifically, this thesis analyzes how the core values of authenticity, consumerism, spectacle, and apology surface in varied practices of gendered image manipulation, engaging and shaping producers and consumers alike as political subjects."
